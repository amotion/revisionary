  "readme": "# Client Library for the Dropbox API\n\nThis is a JavaScript client library for the Dropbox API,\n[written in CoffeeScript](./guides/coffee_faq.md), suitable for use in both modern\nbrowsers and in server-side code running under [node.js](http://nodejs.org/).\n\n\n## Supported Platforms\n\nThis library is tested against the following JavaScript platforms.\n\n* [node.js](http://nodejs.org/) 0.6, 0.8 and 0.10\n* [Chrome](http://www.google.com/chrome) 28\n* [Firefox](http://www.mozilla.org/firefox) 22\n* [Internet Explorer](https://github.com/xdissent/ievms) 9 and 10\n* [Chrome extensions](http://developer.chrome.com/extensions) in the Chrome\n  browser mentioned above\n* [Chrome packaged apps](http://developer.chrome.com/apps/) in the Chrome\n  browser mentioned above\n* [Cordova](http://cordova.apache.org/) 3.1.0\n\nKeep in mind that the versions above are not hard requirements.\n\n\n## Installation and Usage\n\nThe [getting started guide](./guides/getting_started.md) will help you get your\nfirst dropbox.js application up and running.\n\nThe [code snippets guide](./guides/snippets.md) contains some JavaScript\nfragments that may be useful in the latter stages of application development.\nThe [sample apps](./samples/) source code can be useful as a scaffold or as an\nillustration of how all the pieces fit together.\n\nThe\n[dropbox.js API reference](http://coffeedoc.info/github/dropbox/dropbox-js/master/class_index.html)\ncan be a good place to bookmark while building your application.\n\nIf you run into a problem, take a look at\n[the dropbox.js GitHub issue list](https://github.com/dropbox/dropbox-js/issues).\nPlease [open a new issue](https://github.com/dropbox/dropbox-js/issues/new)\nif your problem wasn't already reported.\n\n\n## Versioning\n\nThis project mostly follows semantic versioning.\n\nUntil the library reaches version 1.0, changes to the public API will always\ncarry a minor version bump, such as going from 0.7.2 to 0.8.0. Patch releases\n(e.g. 0.8.0 -> 0.8.1) may introduce new features that don't break the public\nAPI.\n\n\n## Development\n\nThe [development guide](./guides/development.md) will make your life easier if\nyou need to change the source code.\n\nThis library is written in CoffeeScript.\n[These notes](./guides/coffee_faq.md) can help you understand if that matters\nto you.\n\n\n## Platform-Specific Issues\n\nThis lists the most serious problems that you might run into while using\n`dropbox.js`. See\n[the GitHub issue list](https://github.com/dropbox/dropbox-js/issues) for a\nfull list of outstanding problems.\n\n### Internet Explorer 9\n\nThe library only works when used from `https://` pages, due to\n[these issues](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ieinternals/archive/2010/05/13/xdomainrequest-restrictions-limitations-and-workarounds.aspx).\n\nReading and writing binary files is unsupported.\n\nAt the moment, there are no plans for fixing these issues.\n\n\n## Copyright and License\n\nThe library is Copyright (c) 2012 Dropbox Inc., and distributed under the MIT\nLicense.\n",
